            <h3>Role:-</h3>
            <p>Role of HTML In Web Development: -
                Further, HTML coding is a building block of any web page. Web pages combine to form a website. A website is a collection of different web pages. We use specific coding to develop each page. So, there are three major components of a web page. Firstly, we consider HTML. Secodly, Java and further, CSS. All the components in web development are necessary. One without the other is something incomplete. But if we see the importance and the power of HTML, we see that HTML, as by name is capable to deal with text. Java is the functionality of text and CSS is its design.</p>
