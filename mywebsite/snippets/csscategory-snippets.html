    	   <h3>About CSS:-</h3>
    	   <p>CSS was introduced in 1996. It was created to stop people from having to repeat a lot of code. For example, if someone wanted to change the paragraph text, they would have to do it every single time they wanted to change the properties. CSS has since become more adapted to having more features, for example you can now use the # and change the background to a massive array of colours.CSS is a formatting language used to add styling to your page. This is done by having the CSS document linked into your html page. This page then has selectors and properties which affect the tags inside your html document.</p>

            <h3>Features:-</h3>
            <p> CSS, is a very simple designed process used to make the web pages a lot more presentable. CSS allows you to put styles to customize your web pages. The best part about making use of this styling feature is that the CSS is independent of the HTML way of creating web pages. The basic difference between the Hypertext Markup Language and the Cascading Style Sheets is that the former is mainly known to provide the structural way of the landscape to the web page while the former is meant to provide powerful color coding and styling techniques.</p>

            <h3>Role:-</h3>
            <p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets plays an important role in web design. Style sheet is a reference to the document itself but it is the term â€˜cascading' that gives CSS its unique quality. When changes are made in one style sheet, CSS enables these changes across all the style sheets, much like the cascading or ripple effect of a waterfall. It allows you to develop the overall look of your website. While HTML focuses on the content and structure of a website, CSS is concerned with elements of presentation such as layout, font and colour. Before CSS came to be used, all these elements had to be included within the HTML itself, which made the documents more complex. This division of functions between HTML and CSS allows web designers greater control over the web pages.</p>
